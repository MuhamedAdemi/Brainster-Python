## Brainster Academy Data Science Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for Data Science projects created during my learning journey at **Brainster Academy**. This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my progress, knowledge, and skills in data science, as well as the practical applications of the concepts I’ve learned.

### About This Repository

In this repository, you will find Python files and notebooks that cover a wide range of topics in data science, including but not limited to:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data preprocessing techniques.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights from datasets.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models for classification, regression, and other tasks.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing models to achieve the best possible accuracy.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to document my hands-on experience with real-world datasets and tools in data science. It also serves as a reference for:

- Showcasing my skills to potential employers or collaborators.
- Revisiting key concepts and code implementations in the future.
- Sharing my work with fellow learners and the broader data science community.

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
